# Ignore the Letters

D.T. Tive was a well-known investigator in his region. One day, he discovered a fraud involving some people. He found several papers, which informed the values that were deviated by these people. However, the numbers had letters in the middle, to make it difficult to extract the values, and perform the total sum of each paper. The researcher asked for your help to develop an algorithm that removes the letters from the papers and calculates the values that were deviated.  

###### Input

The input has several test cases. Each test case starts with an integer N, telling you how many values are on a paper. Then, they will have N values read, formed by numbers and letters.  

###### Output

The output should show the sum of the numerical values, with the letters properly removed. In the case of example, we have: 1 + 2 + 13 = 16
